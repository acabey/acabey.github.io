A pedagogical triumph!
<p>
This book is virtually unique. By presenting object-oriented programming
from the twin viewpoints of java and c++, the author gives a
3-dimensional perspective of object-oriented programming.
<p>
There are three groups of programmers who would benefit from this
book. Firstly, those who have mastered an imperative language like C and
who are totally new to object oriented programming. Learning both java
and c++ by reading one book can save a tremendous amount of time.
<p>
But two equally important audiences for this book are those programmers
who know only c++ or java, and want to learn the other language. If you
are either of these camps, this is the book you've been waiting for. It
can be read as a "programming cookbook" showing how to do almost every
common programming task, from copying files to Gui/Database programming
in both java and c++, allowing the reader to leverage expertise in one
language when learning the other.
