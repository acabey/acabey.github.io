                            Richard Matthew Stallman is known today for his outspoken activism for "free software,"
                            a movement closely intertwined with Stallman's own history in software development 
                            that has gained traction for its implications on 'larger' issues such as privacy, 
                            social class, and modern digital economics.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            <br>Following his successes in developing a free, UNIX-like computer system, the GNU project,
                            Stallman has spent the last two decades as a prophet for free software.
                            He has actively promoted ethical software buisiness practices, the development and the implementation of
                            free software. He has campaigned against DRM, software patents and other systems that restrict users' freedoms.
                            Stallman is the founder and incumbent President of the Free Software Foundation, a non-profit 
                            organization that has dedicated resources to the development of free software and 
                            worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community.

                          Stallman was hired in the summer of 1970, following his senior year of high school, 
                          to write a numerical analysis program in Fortran.
                          After completing the task, he swore never to use Fortran again 
                          and turned his attention toward writing a text editor 
                          in APL and a preprocessor for the PL/I programming language.

                          became a regular in the hacker community. Stallman graduated from Harvard

                          dependency-directed backtracking; this was an early work on the problem 
                          of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems.

                          In September of 1983, Stallman announced his intent to begin work on the GNU project
                          via Usenet messaging. In 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to focus entirely on 
                          the GNU project. Starting with only basic text editing and compiler compiler tools, 
                          Stallman would go on to develop an entire free, open-source UNIX compatible operating system.
