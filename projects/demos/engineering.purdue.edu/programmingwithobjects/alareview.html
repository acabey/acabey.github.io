As someone who knows both C++ and Java fairly well, this reviewer, when
he first saw this title, braced for a fairly nit-picky side-by-side
coverage of the basic syntax and language element features of C++ and
Java. Was he pleasantly surprised! Instead, Kak (Purdue Univ.) has
created a wonderful volume that surveys the most important of
programming goals and capabilities and describes how the facilities of
each language allow one to achieve those goals. In several cases, the
author reached to describe de facto C++ libraries to show how to do
things in C++ that can be done in Java using Java's standard
facilities. For example, in the section comparing GUI (graphical user
interface) interaction capabilities, the author describes, in
more-than-expected detailed examples, how to use GTK+ and Qt. Even if
one knows Java and C++, or perhaps especially if one does not know Java
and C++, this book is a very worthwhile read. Readers are sure to learn
something about each language from this comparison.
