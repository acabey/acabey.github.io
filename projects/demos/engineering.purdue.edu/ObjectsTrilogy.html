This project is based on the premise that just as natural
languages anchor human thought, programming languages anchor
our understanding of the world of computing.  So if you want
to understand the potential and the limitations of the smart
systems of the future, you must first come to terms with the
basic vocabulary of such systems.  Although there are many
levels of abstraction in this vocabulary, at its base it is
rooted in the nouns, the verbs, and the other qualifiers of
the programming languages.

<br>
<br>

So back around 1997 I set out to create a trilogy on
programming with objects. 
The first two volumes, <font color="blue"><B><i>Programming with Objects</i></B></font> and
<font color="blue"><B><i>Scripting with Objects</i></B></font>, have been out for some time
and are currently being used in several educational programs
around the world.  By comparing the programming idioms in
closely related languages, and, at the same time, by
teaching how to program in each language, these two books
present a multi-dimensional perspective on object-oriented
programming and scripting.  <font color="red">I firmly believe that, for those
readers who are of a serious bent of mind, a comparative
presentation of similar yet different programming languages
is far more conducive to developing deep insights into the
programming syntax than the more traditional
one-language-at-a-time style of learning.</font>  Additionally, we
now live in a world of multi-language computing.  Even the
simplest of applications may require programming to be
carried out in two or more languages.  So we might as well
get used to learning multiple languages simultaneously.

<br>
<br>

The writing for the third book of the trilogy, <strong><i><font color="blue">Designing
with Objects</font></i></strong>, was finished in December 2013 and the book
was released by Wiley on January 20, 2015.  <font color="red">Different from
any you'd have seen in software engineering, this book is an
offbeat attempt at explaining the design patterns with the
help of short-story snippets drawn from Harry Potter.</font>  The
code that is used to explain the patterns emulates the
interactions between the various characters in the
stories. I believe that this is a more interesting approach
to explaining the patterns, particularly so the more complex
patterns, than the sterile approaches out there that give
meaningless names to classes and their roles, or the
approaches in which the names and the roles assigned to
classes are based on some engineering application that the
reader may have zero interest in.

<br>

If you have any questions about the trilogy, please send
them to me at kak@purdue.edu with "objects trilogy project"
in the subject line to get past my otherwise tight spam
filter.
