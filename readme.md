# acabey.xyz

My portfolio site built using pure HTML+CSS and no Javascript (NoJS/LibreJS friendly).

Cloud9 was used as a development environment throughout.

The site is entirely made up of static pages and hosted through Github pages with a DNS registration through Namecheap and SSL through Cloudflare
